This is the process of building a phone number scraping regex.

First, we need to match an area code (3 digits), a trunk (3 digits), and an extension (4 digits):

reg = re.compile("\d{3}\d{3}\d{4}")

Now, we want to capture the matched phone number, so we add parenthesis around the parts that we're interested in capturing (all of it):

reg = re.compile("(\d{3}\d{3}\d{4})")

The area code, trunk, and extension might be separated by up to 3 characters that are not digits (such as the case when spaces are used along with the hyphen/dot delimiter):

reg = re.compile("(\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{4})")

Now, the phone number might actually start with a ( character (if the area code is enclosed in parentheses):

reg = re.compile("(\(?\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{4}).*?")

Now that whole phone number is likely embedded in a bunch of other text:

reg = re.compile(".*?(\(?\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{4}).*?")

Now, that other text might include newlines:

reg = re.compile(".*?(\(?\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{3}\D{0,3}\d{4}).*?", re.S)

Enjoy!
